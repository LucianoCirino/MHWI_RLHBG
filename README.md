# Monster Hunter World: Iceborne - `Reverse Ledge Heavy Bowgun`

Reverse Ledge Heavy Bowgun (RLHBG) is an exploit in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne (MHW:I) with the Heavy Bowgun that gives the player the ability to cancel recoil/reload animations on a ledge.
The main premise of RLHBG is to fall off a ledge and have a timed aerial shot land you at the very tip of the ledge.
In MHW:I, landing after having shot in the air causes players to land with forward momentum, so if near a ledge, one can use this to auto-propel back off the ledge (and then repeat the process).

This script was designed to work with Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. It's also compatible with the popular mod ICE.

# RLHBG/Script Notes
- RLHBG is much quicker when not Aiming Down Sights (No ADS) because there is a much smaller delay for firing after falling.
- There are some very rare ledges where one can enter "SubMachine Gun mode". These ledges are so rare ive only ever encountered
 two of them, on in the training area, and one where Lunastra spawns.
- The Ammo+ tab seems to have its UI all broken, so I would avoid using it...

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following mods installed from Nexus for optimal performance:

- **Performance Booster and Plugin Extender**

- **Tic Rate Fix**

- **Strackers Loader**

## Other

1. Ensure the game is locked at **60fps**. Any inconsistencies in frame rate can lead to timing issues with the script.
2. The scope is **not compatible** with Reverse Ledge HBG.
3. For optimal script performance, make sure your controls match the script's keyboard bindings.

## Usage

1. Run the `MHWI_RLHBG_v...` ahk script to start.
2. If you've started the script before loading into town, simply reload it. The script will automatically reload after any equipment menu closes. If issues arise, first try reloading. If problems persist, reset the script to its defaults and re-attempt.
3. Hotkey commands are PS4 Controller friendly.
4. Activate RLHBG using the default hotkey (F8), then walk off the ledge without aiming down sights to initiate.
5. When the script is running, try to limit your inputs to ensure accuracy.
6. Keep in mind, several features of this script are experimental, so you may encounter bugs.

## Closing
I made this script a long time ago and don't plan on ever updating it :^)
