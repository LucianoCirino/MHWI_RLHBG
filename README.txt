1. This script was designed to work with a Heavy Bowgun (HBG) in "Monster Hunter World:Iceborne" (Also works with ICE).
2. For script to work properly, you must have installed the following mods from Nexus:
	a) Performance Booster and Plugin Extender - https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/3473?tab=files&file_id=20484
	b) Tic Rate Fix - https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/3474?tab=files&file_id=17858
	c) Better Input Detection - https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/4333
	d) Strackers Loader - https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/1982
3. Script currently only works with game locked at 60fps. If your game is unable to maintain 60fps the script will mess up timinngs.
4. The scope does not work with Reverse Ledge HBG.
5. To start, run the "MHWI_RLHBG_v..." ahk script.
6. If script was opened prior to loading into town, reload script. Script will automatically reload itself after any equipment menu closes.
When something seems off in script, try reloading it. If all fails, reset script to its defaults and try again. Make sure your controls match script's Keyboard bindings.
7. Script hotkey commands are designed to be able to work with a PS4 Controller.
8. Once you enable RLHBG by the assigned hotkey (default f8), walk off ledge with no aim down sights to begin.
9. While script is in motion, attempt to minimize your inputs as they will affect your results.
10. Many aspects of the script remain untested... which means there are probably many bugs.
