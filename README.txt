## Notes

1. Ensure the game is locked at **60fps**. Any inconsistencies in frame rate can lead to timing issues with the script.
2. The scope is **not compatible** with Reverse Ledge HBG.
3. For optimal script performance, make sure your controls match the script's keyboard bindings.

## Usage

1. Run the `MHWI_RLHBG_v...` ahk script to start.
2. If you've started the script before loading into town, simply reload it. The script will automatically reload after any equipment menu closes. If issues arise, first try reloading. If problems persist, reset the script to its defaults and re-attempt.
3. Hotkey commands are PS4 Controller friendly.
4. Activate RLHBG using the default hotkey (F8), then walk off the ledge without aiming down sights to initiate.
5. When the script is running, try to limit your inputs to ensure accuracy.
6. Keep in mind, several features of this script are experimental, so you may encounter bugs.
